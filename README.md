- **SQLite3**
- **Optional:** Aviation Stack API key (free tier: 100 calls/month)

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install requests
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install dump1090

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install dump1090-mutability
```

**Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dump1090-fa

git clone https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090.git
cd dump1090
make
```

### 2. Clone This Repository

cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Cnd-North/adsb-flight-tracker.git
cd adsb-flight-tracker
```

### 3. (Optional) Configure API Keys

**Aviation Stack** (for route data):
```bash
export AVIATIONSTACK_KEY='your-key-here'
```

Get your free API key at [aviationstack.com](https://aviationstack.com/product)

### 4. Start dump1090

```bash
dump1090 --net --gain -10 --metric --write-json ./dump1090-fa-web/public_html/data &
```

Or for dump1090-fa:
```bash
sudo systemctl start dump1090-fa
```

### 5. Start the Flight Logger

```bash
python3 flight_logger_enhanced.py
```

The database will be created automatically on first run.

### 6. Start the Log API Server

## 📊 Intelligent Route Optimizer

The route optimizer makes your limited API calls count by intelligently prioritizing interesting flights:

### Priority Scoring System

| Flight Type | Score | Examples |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| 🎖️ Military | +100 | RCH345, SPAR12, NAVY456 |
| ✈️ Private/GA | +80 | N12345, C-GABC |
| 📦 Cargo | +60 | FDX1234, UPS789, GTI456 |
| 🌍 International | +30 | Non-US/Canada aircraft |
| 🔁 Common Routes (3+ times) | -100 | LAX-JFK, SFO-EWR |

### Dynamic Thresholds

The system adjusts its selectivity based on remaining API quota:

- **>50 calls:** Threshold = 20 (generous)
- **20-50 calls:** Threshold = 50 (prioritize interesting)
- **5-20 calls:** Threshold = 80 (cargo/private/military only)
- **<5 calls:** Threshold = 100 (military/exceptional only)

This means your 100 free API calls can track 200-300 flights by skipping common commercial routes!

---

## 📈 Usage Tips

### Maximizing API Efficiency

1. **Let the optimizer run for a few days** - It learns common routes in your area
2. **Monitor quota usage:** `python3 api_quota_manager.py status`
3. **Adjust thresholds** if you're in a high-traffic area
4. **Common routes are cached** - The system won't call API for repeat flights

### Signal Quality Optimization

1. **Position your antenna high** - Rooftop/attic is best
2. **Minimize obstacles** - Clear line of sight to the sky
3. **Use quality coax** - Low-loss cable if >10 feet from receiver
4. **Run signal analytics:** `python3 signal_analytics.py`
5. **Check the signal monitor** - http://localhost:8080/signal-monitor.html

### Data Quality

Run these scripts periodically to maintain clean data:
```bash
python3 normalize_manufacturers.py    # Fix manufacturer name variants
python3 remove_duplicates_simple.py   # Remove duplicate entries
python3 fix_corrupted_aircraft.py     # Fix OpenSky database corruption
```

### Emergency Detection

**This tracker uses ONLY transponder squawk codes for emergency detection:**
- **7500** = Aircraft Hijacking / Unlawful Interference
- **7600** = Radio Failure / Loss of Communication
- **7700** = General Emergency / Requiring Immediate Assistance

**Why we ignore the ADS-B emergency field:**

The ADS-B emergency field is unreliable and causes false positives. Testing showed regular commercial flights (Air Canada, WestJet, FedEx, United) being incorrectly flagged as emergencies with normal squawk codes.

**Technical reasons:**
1. Many aircraft don't properly implement ADS-B emergency status (Type 28 message)
2. Field is set during ground testing and maintenance
3. Triggered by non-emergency statuses (low fuel warnings, medical flights, priority statuses)
4. Cannot distinguish emergency types

**Squawk codes are the gold standard:**
- Deliberately set by pilots
- Recognized worldwide by ATC
- No false positives
- Clear, specific meaning

If you see emergency records with normal squawk codes in an older database, run:
```bash
python3 cleanup_adsb_emergencies.py --fix
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Aircraft Detected

1. **Check dump1090 is running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep dump1090
   ```

2. **Check RTL-SDR is connected:**
   ```bash
   lsusb | grep -i realtek
   rtl_test -t
   ```

3. **Verify antenna connection** - Check coax connectors are tight

4. **Check signal monitor** - http://localhost:8080/signal-monitor.html
   - You should see a waterfall display even without aircraft

### API Quota Exhausted

1. **Check remaining quota:**
   ```bash
   python3 api_quota_manager.py status
   ```

2. **Quota resets on 1st of each month** - Wait for reset or upgrade plan

3. **Optimizer will automatically skip API calls** when quota is depleted

### Web Interface Not Loading

1. **Check log API server is running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep log_server
   ```

2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f log_server.py
   python3 log_server.py &
   ```

3. **Check firewall settings** - Ensure port 8080 and 8081 are open
